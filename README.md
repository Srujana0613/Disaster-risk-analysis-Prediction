# 🍷 Wine Classification using k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This machine learning project implements a **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** classifier to perform wine classification based on a given dataset. The classifier is tested with both **1-NN** and **3-NN** configurations to evaluate accuracy.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The objective of this project is to:
- Load the **Wine Classification Dataset**
- Implement the **1-NNC (1-Nearest Neighbor Classifier)** and **3-NNC (3-Nearest Neighbor Classifier)**
- Measure and compare their performance on test data

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

The **k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors)** algorithm is a non-parametric, instance-based learning method used for classification. It assigns a class to a test sample based on the majority vote of its `k` nearest neighbors in the feature space.
